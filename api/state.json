Project setup\n\nLet's dive right in. Start a terminal and change to the directory\nyou want to work in. For this tutorial we'll use `~/alva/` in examples,\nscreenshots and screencasts but any location on your computer works.\n\n## 1a) Git initialization\n\nCreate a folder, change into it and initialize it as a git repository.\n\n```\nmkdir component-library\ncd component-library\ngit init\n```\n\nPlace a `.gitignore` in the same folder next. This will cause `git` to\nomit the listed files and folders when committing, which helps us to\nkeep our commit history clear and meaningful.\n\n```sh\n# .gitgnore\nlib\nnode_modules\n.DS_Store\n```\n\nIf everything worked `git status` should create the following output for you:\n\n```sh\n$ git status\nOn branch master\n\nNo commits yet\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n\t.gitignore\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n```\n\n## 1b) Add required npm meta data\n\n> [[details | Shortcut]]\n> |\n> | ```\n> | git clone --single-branch --branch 1b-add-required-npm-meta-data https://github.com/meetalva/component-library-starter.git\n> | ```\n\nAlva uses some meta data commonly found in `npm` packages to distinguish between different libraries. You will also select the `package.json` file used to store this meta data when connecting component libraries to Alva.\n\nSo let's create a `package.json` file. Luckily `npm` has us covered and\nmakes this a matter of one command.\n\n```\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nAfter successful init, you should find a new `package.json` in your directory with content like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"component-library\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\"\n}\n```\n\n### 1c) Add dependencies\n\n> [[details | Shortcut]]\n> |\n> | ```\n> | git clone --single-branch --branch 1c-add-dependencies https://github.com/meetalva/component-library-starter.git\n> | cd component-library-starter\n> | npm install\n> | ```\n\n\nWe'll use some dependencies to create our components. This includes React\nand styled-components. Add and save them to your project like this:\n\n```\nnpm install --save \\\n  react@16.6.3 \\\n  react-dom@16.6.3 \\\n  styled-components@4.1.2 \\\n  @types/react@16.7.17 \\\n  @types/react-dom@16.0.11 \\\n  styled-components@4.1.2\n```\n\nAfter successful installation your `package.json` should look like this:\n\n```json{13-18}\n{\n  \"name\": \"component-library\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@types/react\": \"^16.7.17\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^16.0.11\",\n    \"@types/styled-components\": \"^4.1.4\",\n    \"react\": \"^16.6.3\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\",\n    \"styled-components\": \"^4.1.2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 1d) Add TypeScript\n\n> [[details | Shortcut]]\n> |\n> | ```\n> | git clone --single-branch --branch 1d-add-typescript https://github.com/meetalva/component-library-starter.git\n> | cd component-library-starter\n> | npm install\n> | ```\n\n\nAlva analyzes your component interfaces to find out which\ndata to feed into them. The easiest way to provide those\ninterfaces is to write our components in TypeScript, so we'll do that.\n\nLet's install and configure TypeScript:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev typescript@3.2.2\n```\n\nThis should cause `npm` to add a new `devDependencies` entry:\n\n```json{21}\n{\n  \"name\": \"component-library\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@types/react\": \"^16.7.17\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^16.0.11\",\n    \"@types/styled-components\": \"^4.1.4\",\n    \"react\": \"^16.6.3\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\",\n    \"styled-components\": \"^4.1.2\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"typescript\": \"^3.2.2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOn its own TypeScript won't do much, we have to configure it.\nLet' create a `tsconfig.json` for this. The configuration\nvalues required for Alva to work correctly are highlighted below.\n\n```js{4-6}\n// tsconfig.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"declaration\": true,\n    \"jsx\": \"react\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"lib\": [\"dom\", \"es2015\"],\n    \"module\": \"es2015\",\n    \"outDir\": \"./lib\",\n    \"target\": \"es2015\",\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nFinally let's create a shortcut so we can to start the TypeScript compiler\nvia `npm run build`. Notice that we removed the `npm test` placeholder script.\n\n```json{7}\n{\n  \"name\": \"component-library\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"tsc\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@types/react\": \"^16.7.17\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^16.0.11\",\n    \"@types/styled-components\": \"^4.1.4\",\n    \"react\": \"^16.6.3\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\",\n    \"styled-components\": \"^4.1.2\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"typescript\": \"^3.2.2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### 1e) Specify package entry\n\n> [[details | Shortcut]]\n> |\n> | ```\n> | git clone --single-branch --branch 1e-specify-package-entry https://github.com/meetalva/component-library-starter.git\n> | cd component-library-starter\n> | npm install\n> | ```\n\nUsing the configuration above, `tsc` will compile any \n`.ts` file found in `src` to `lib`. \n\n**For Alva to pick up\nour code, we need to point it to the correct file via `main` - in our case that is `lib/index.js`.**\n\nLuckily npm provides a field designed to do this: `main`. We'll change it \nfrom `index.js` to `lib/index.js`. The resulting `package.json` reads:\n\n\n```json{5}\n{\n  \"name\": \"component-library\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"lib/index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"tsc\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@types/react\": \"^16.7.17\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^16.0.11\",\n    \"@types/styled-components\": \"^4.1.4\",\n    \"react\": \"^16.6.3\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\",\n    \"styled-components\": \"^4.1.2\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"typescript\": \"^3.2.2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 1f) Create placeholder files\n\n> [[details | Shortcut]]\n> |\n> | ```\n> | git clone --single-branch --branch 1f-create-placeholder-files https://github.com/meetalva/component-library-starter.git\n> | cd component-library-starter\n> | npm install\n> | npm run build\n> | ```\n\n\nWe place some empty files for `TypeScript` to pick up so we can \nverfiy your setup. Create a `src` folder first:\n\n```\nmkdir src\n```\n\nThen add the following to `src/index.ts`\n\n```ts\n// src/index.ts\n// placeholder entry file\n// export * from './hello-world';\nconsole.log('Hello, World');\n```\n\n### 1g) Verify your setup\n\nExecute `npm run build`, then `tree lib`.\nThe output should look like this:\n\n```\n$ tree lib\nlib\n├── index.d.ts\n└── index.js\n\n0 directories, 2 files\n```\n\nExecuting our build results with `node` should work, too:\n\n```\n$ node lib/index.js\nHello, World\n```\n\n### 1h) Clean up\n\n> [[details | Shortcut]]\n> |\n> | ```\n> | git clone --single-branch --branch 1h-cleanup https://github.com/meetalva/component-library-starter.git\n> | cd component-library-starter\n> | npm install\n> | npm run build\n> | ```\n\nPhew! It was quite a journey from zero to project setup. Congrats you did it! :tada:\n\nThere is just one last thing to do before we can start adding components: \n\nLet's remove our debug `console.log` on the last line in `src/index.ts`.\n\nAfterwards your file looks like this:\n\n```ts\n// src/index.ts\n// placeholder entry file\n// export * from './hello-world';\n```\n\n## 2. Add components\n\n> :information_source:\n> See [Create a Component](./create-pattern) for a dedicated, more detailed guide on creating components. \n\n## 2a) Add a HelloWorld component\n\n> [[details | Shortcut]]\n> |\n> | ```\n> | git clone --single-branch --branch 2a-add-a-helloworld-component https://github.com/meetalva/component-library-starter.git\n> | cd component-library-starter\n> | npm install\n> | npm run build\n> | ```\n\n\nCreate the following files\n\n**src/hello-world.styled.ts**\n\n```tsx\n// src/hello-world.styled.ts\nimport styled from 'styled-components';\n\nexport enum HelloWorldColors {\n  Pale = 'palevioletred',\n  Whip = 'papayawhip',\n  Black = 'black'\n}\n\nexport interface StyledHelloWorldProps {\n  color?: HelloWorldColors;\n}\n\nexport const StyledHelloWorld = styled.h1<StyledHelloWorldProps>`\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n  color: ${props => props.color || HelloWorldColors.Black};\n}`;\n```\n\n**src/hello-world.tsx**\n\n```tsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport * as Styles from './hello-world.styled';\n\nexport interface HelloWorldProps {\n    color?: Styles.HelloWorldColors;\n    children?: React.ReactNode;\n}\n\nexport const HelloWorld: React.SFC<HelloWorldProps> = props => {\n    return <Styles.StyledHelloWorld color={props.color}>{props.children || 'Hello, World!'}</Styles.StyledHelloWorld>\n}\n```\n\n## 2b) Export \n\nChange your entry file at `src/index.ts` to export `src/hello-world.tsx`:\n\n```ts\nexport * from './hello-world';\n```\n\n## 2b) Build\n\nExecute `npm run build` to create JavaScript from your \nbrand-new React TypeScript component:\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\nAfter a successful build `tree lib` prints a file list like this:\n\n```\n$ tree lib\nlib\n├── hello-world.d.ts\n├── hello-world.js\n├── hello-world.styled.d.ts\n├── hello-world.styled.js\n├── index.d.ts\n└── index.js\n\n0 directories, 6 files\n```\n\n### 2c) Connect to Alva\n\n> :information_source:\n> See [Connect a Library](./library) for a dedicated guide on connecting libraries.\n\n* Start Alva. \n* Create a new file (`File > New` or `Cmd+N`)\n* Open connect library dialog (`Library` > `Connect New Library` or `Cmd+Shift+C`)\n* Select `~/alva/component-library/package.json`. Exact location may differ if you chose a different working directory in section 1.\n\nAfter importing your component library successfully Alva should display your `HelloWorld` component on the bottom of the component list.\n\n[[grid]]\n| [[grid-column | 5 - 13 ]]\n| | ![](https://media.meetalva.io/guides/hello-world-component-list.png)\n\n\nDrag your `HelloWorld` component to the element list above or doubleclick on it.

Add a Hello World component\n\n!(video:https://media.meetalva.io/video/add-hello-world.m4v)\n\nOpen your favorite text editor in the Alva Designkit folder you just \nconnected to Alva. We'll show [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in screenshots and videos but any text editor will do.\n\nLet's create a new folder called \"Hello World\" with an `index.tsx` file in it:\n\n\n> `mkdir src/hello-world && touch src/hello-world/index.tsx`\n\nAdd the following code to it. It is a simple React component rendering \"Hello, World!\" into an `<h1>` tag:\n\n```ts\nimport * as React from 'react';\n\nexport const HelloWorld: React.SFC = () => {\n\treturn (\n\t\t<h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n\t)\n}\n```\n\n!(video:https://media.meetalva.io/video/export-hello-world.m4v)\n\nThis won't do anyhting on its own in Alva just yet. Let's add our brand new component to `src/index.ts` to change that:\n\n```ts{4}\n/** lines omitted */\nexport * from './space';\nexport * from './teaser';\nexport * from './hello-world';\n```\n\n## 3. Build your changes\n\nFor Alva to understand your new code you need to build it with the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) compiler.\nLet's do that real quick. Execute the following command in your Alva Designkit folder.\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\nWhen TypeScript is done translating your code the terminal window should resemble this:\n\n```\nλ npm run build\n\n> meetalva-designkit@1.0.0 build /Users/marneb/Documents/alva/designkit\n> tsc\n\n~/alva/designkit\nλ\n```\n\nWe are all set, let's switch back to Alva.\n\n## 4. Update Designkit in your Alva project\n\n!(video:https://media.meetalva.io/video/update-library.m4v)\n\nStart Alva and open the project you created while working through the [Connect a Library Guide](./library). \n\nOn the `meetalva-designkit` card hit the \"Update\" button. Wait for the card to switch back from \"Connecting\" to \"Connected\".\n\n\n## 5. Use the Hello World component\n\n!(video:https://media.meetalva.io/video/use-hello-world.m4v)\n\nLet's put our component to use! Click on the search bar above\nthe pattern list and type in \"Hello World\" (without quotation marks).\n\nYou should now see \"Hello, World\" into your preview, rendered by your very first component connected to Alva. \n\nCongratulations! :tada:\n\n## Next\n\n* **Next**: [Create Properties](./create-properties?guides-enabled=true)\n","contentType":"doc","path":"docs/guides/create-pattern.md","manifest":{"name":"guide-6---create-a-pattern","displayName":"Guide 6 - Create a Pattern","description":"","flag":"alpha","options":{},"tags":["guide"],"version":"1.0.0"},"rawManifest":{"displayName":"Guide 6 - Create a Pattern","tags":["guide"]}},{"id":"docs/guides/create-properties","contents":"---\ndisplayName: Guide 7 - Create Properties\n\ntags:\n  - guide\n---\n\n# Guide 7 - Create Properties\n\n Learn how to make your patterns configurable with property interfaces.\n\n:woman_student: **Level**: Intermediate\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Add a greeting property\n\n!(video:https://media.meetalva.io/video/props-add-greeting.m4v)\n\nLocate the implementation of our `Hello World` component at `~/alva/src/hello-world/index.tsx`.\nOpen it with your favourite text editor. We'll use VSCode in our screenshots and screencasts but \nyou are not required to use it.\n\nYou should see a file resembling the code below:\n\n```ts\nimport * as React from 'react';\n\nexport const HelloWorld: React.SFC = () => {\n\treturn (\n\t\t<h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n\t)\n}\n```\n\nLet's take our componen a bit further. We'll let users\ndecide on the greeting they want to use.\n\nLet's set a foundation annd add a `HelloWorldProps` TypeScript interface.\nWe'll leave it empty for now and fill in our props in the next step.\n\n```ts{3-5,7}\nimport * as React from 'react';\n\nexport interface HelloWorldProps {\n\n}\n\nexport const HelloWorld: React.SFC<HelloWorldProps> = () => {\n\treturn (\n\t\t<h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n\t)\n}\n```\n\n> ℹ️\n> Notice how we export the `HelloWorldsProps` interface?\n> This is important for Alva to be able to find interfaces \n> and components it is supposed to analyze and list. \n> \n> Without `export` this won't be picked up by Alva!\n\nNow let's specify we accept a string that gets rendered instead \nof \"Hello\":\n\n```ts{4,9}\nimport * as React from 'react';\n\nexport interface HelloWorldProps {\n\tgreeting?: string; \n}\n\nexport const HelloWorld: React.SFC<HelloWorldProps> = (props) => {\n\treturn (\n\t\t<h1>{props.greeting || 'Hello'}, World!</h1>\n\t)\n}\n```\n\n## 3. See your new Property in Alva\n\n!(video:https://media.meetalva.io/video/props-use-greeting.m4v)\n\nRemember to execute the TypeScript compiler via `npm run build`.\n\nThen fire up Alva, open a new file and connect your Designkit.\nLocate the `HelloWorld` component via search in the component list.\n\nDouble-click the component or drag it on Alvas element list. You should \nsee \"Hello, World\" in your project preview.\n\nNotice how the property list on the right side of the preview now \nshows an input with the label `greeting`? That's the property we just added!\n\nLet's type something in there, e.g. \"Moin\" (I am from Hamburg, Germany - sue me.)\nSee how the preview updates with every keystroke? \n\n## 4. More properties\n\n!(video:https://media.meetalva.io/video/props-add-scope.m4v)\n\nThat's pretty cool, right? Let's try another one. We'll let the user\nselect from a range of scopes for the second word in our greeting. \nLet's go with this list:\n\n* Hamburg\n* Europe\n* World\n* Solar System\n* Galaxy\n* Universe\n\nTo do that we'll use an TypeScript `enum` like this:\n\n```ts{3-10,14,19}\nimport * as React from 'react';\n\nexport enum HelloScope {\n\tHamburg = \"Hamburg\",\n\tEurope = \"Europe\",\n\tWorld = \"World\",\n\tSolarSystem = \"Solar System\",\n\tGalaxy = \"Galaxy\",\n\tUniverse = \"Universe\"\n}\n\nexport interface HelloWorldProps {\n\tgreeting?: string; \n\tscope?: HelloScope;\n}\n\nexport const HelloWorld: React.SFC<HelloWorldProps> = (props) => {\n\treturn (\n\t\t<h1>{props.greeting || 'Hello'}, {props.scope || 'World'}!</h1>\n\t)\n}\n```\n\nYou might ask why we bothered with the additional code for our new `scope` property when we simply could have \nused a `string` again. \n\nOne nice thing about `enums` is that we now know the **finite**\nset of possibilites for this prop. Alva uses this fact to render a nicer edit UI.\n\nLet's update the designkit in our Alva file again. Then select the HelloWorld element\nyou created earlier by clicking on it. Notice the second input in the property pane?\n\nThat's an select, the input type Alva chooses for properties of type `enum`.\n\nYou just mastered the fundamentals of making your components configurable and data-driven. Well done! :clap:\n\n> ❔\n> See our [Property Reference](../references/properties) for details on how Alva parses and\nanalyzes your React components' interfaces.\n\n---\n\n## Next\n\n* **Next**: [Create a Pattern Library](./doc/docs/guides/create-library?guides-enabled=true)\n","contentType":"doc","path":"docs/guides/create-properties.md","manifest":{"name":"guide-7---create-properties","displayName":"Guide 7 - Create Properties","description":"","flag":"alpha","options":{},"tags":["guide"],"version":"1.0.0"},"rawManifest":{"displayName":"Guide 7 - Create Properties","tags":["guide"]}},{"id":"docs/guides/design","contents":"---\ndisplayName: Guide 2 – Design Drafts\n\ntags:\n  - guide\n---\n\n# Guide 2 - Add Design Drafts\n\n:woman_student: **Level**: Beginner\n\n---\n\nIn this guide you will learn how to integrate your freshest design drafts into your prototype.\n\n## 1.

Alva should greet you with the following screen.\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/alva-greeting.png)\n\n\n## 3. Create a new file and add content to it\n\nClick on `Create new Alva File`. You find a list of essential patterns on the bottom left of the next screen.\nLocate the `Text` pattern and drop it onto the element pane right above the patterns list.\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/guides/guide-01-01.gif)\n\nThat’s it – we added your first component to our prototype!\n\n## 3. Adjust a Property\nAfter you selected the newly added text component, have a look at the right side of Alva. There are all **properties** – like settings – of the component shown. In this case it’s just a single one – the text value. Let’s **change** that to `Hello Alva!`.\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/properties.png)\n\n## 4. Add a Box Component\nLet’s add another component. Besides dragging a component, we just double-click on the **Box Component**. The Box Component has way more properties. Let’s change the `height` to `400px` and the **background-color** to `#DA046E`.\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/box-color.png)\n\n## 5. Re-Order Elements\nAs you already may have found out, elements that support children elements have a small arrow on the left side. You can drag and drop elements into them. Let’s **move the text element into the box element**!\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/box-nesting.png)\n\n---\n\n### Next\nHooray! You learned the essentials of working with Alva. Let’s jump to the next topic – how to integrate your design drafts into the prototype.\n\n[Guide 2: Add Design Drafts](./doc/docs/guides/design?guides-enabled=true)\n","contentType":"doc","path":"docs/guides/essentials.md","manifest":{"name":"guide-1---essentials","displayName":"Guide 1 – Essentials","description":"","flag":"alpha","options":{},"tags":["guide"],"version":"1.0.0"},"rawManifest":{"displayName":"Guide 1 – Essentials","tags":["guide"]}},{"id":"docs/guides/interaction","contents":"---\ndisplayName: Guide 4 – Interaction\n\ntags:\n  - guide\n---\n\n# Guide 4 - Interaction\n\n:woman_student: **Level**: Beginner\n\n---\n\nIn this guide you will learn how to link pages and bring life into your prototype.\n\n## 1. Add Page\nOn the left side of Alva all of the pages are shown. Let’s **add a page** and give it a name.\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/guides/guide-03-01.gif)\n\n## 2. Add Button\nWe need an interactive component. Let’s **add a button**, for example.\n\n> Technical Note: For Interactive Elements you need an `React.MouseEventHandler`or `React.EventHandler` property.\n\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/guides/guide-03-02.gif)\n\n## 3. Link Page\nBelow the usual button properties such as Order or Disabled, you’ll find an **Interaction Property**. **Set it to** `Switch to Page` and **select the page** you want to link to below. That’s it!\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/guides/guide-03-03.gif)\n\n## 4. Click\nWell, because usually when you click on an element in the preview it gets selected, we have to test our interaction differently. **Hold *CMD* on macOS or *Ctrl* on Windows and click on the Button**. Yay, you just switched to the other page! After exporting your prototype you won’t need to hold those keys anymore.\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/guides/guide-03-04.gif)\n\n---\n\n## Next\n\nLearn how to connect a compatible code component library\n* **Next**: [Variables](./doc/docs/guides/variables?guides-enabled=true)\n","contentType":"doc","path":"docs/guides/interaction.md","manifest":{"name":"guide-4---interaction","displayName":"Guide 4 – Interaction","description":"","flag":"alpha","options":{},"tags":["guide"],"version":"1.0.0"},"rawManifest":{"displayName":"Guide 4 – Interaction","tags":["guide"]}},{"id":"docs/guides/library","contents":"---\ndisplayName: Guide 3 - Connect a Library\n\ntags:\n  - guide\n---\n\n#  Guide 3 - Connect a Pattern Library\n\n:woman_student: **Level**: Intermediate\n\n---\n\n> If you want to skip this guide, feel free to download our [Playground Alva-File](http://media.meetalva.io/file/Website.alva) with a pre-connected library to proceed.\n\n---\n\n> :information_source: This guide teaches how to connect an Alva project to the ready-made Alva Designkit. \n\n> For a guide on how to create a custom pattern library from scratch, see [Create a custom Library](./doc/docs/guides/create-library?guides-enabled=true).\n\n---\n\nIn this guide you will learn how to bring your prototype to live by connecting it to a pattern library. We'll also have a look on how to use the connected patterns.\n\nThis will involve a bit of work in the terminal. Don't worry if you are unfamliar with the terminal, we'll have you covered with a detailed step by step guide.\n\n## You'll need\n\n* :computer: Terminal\n* :evergreen_tree: Git – [Install](https://git-scm.com/)\n* :turtle: Node.js `v8` – [Install](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n\n\n## 1. Clone Alva Designkit\n\nOpen a Terminal window. Type the following command into your terminal.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/meetalva/designkit.git\n```\n\nPress enter to execute the command and download the code from [github.com/meetalva/designkit](https://github.com/meetalva/designkit) into a new local folder called `designkit`.\n\nIf everything worked you should see output resembling this:\n\n```\nCloning into 'designkit'...\nremote: Counting objects: 1409, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (194/194), done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (660/660), done.\n```\n\n## 2. Prepare Alva Designkit for Analysis\n\nNext we have to \"build\" Alva Designkit from the source files we just cloned. \nWe do this to make Alva's life easier when it tries to understand the Designkit's code.\n\nChange into the `designkit` folder with the following terminal command.\n\n```\ncd designkit\n```\n\nThen install the Desingkit's dependencies by typing\n\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\nDepending on your connection speed this may take a while.\n\nOn success the last line of your terminal should look roughly like this:\n\n```\nadded 1059 packages in 13.795s\n```\n\nLet's create the build results for the Alva Desingkit now. You can do so by executing\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis will create JavaScript and typing files from the Designkit TypeScript sources.\n\nRun the following command and keep hold of the path that is printed to the terminal, we'll need it later:\n\n```sh\necho $PWD\n# /Users/alva-user/Desktop\n```\n\n## 3. Connect Designkit to Alva \n\nThe Designkit is now ready to be connected to Alva. Start Alva and create a new project by hitting `Create New Alva File` on the right side of the welcome screen\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io//splash.svg)\n\n---\n\nAlva will display a fresh, empty file. On the right side of the window you can find a \"Connect a library\" teaser. Hit the \"Connect\" button.\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/connect-teaser.svg)\n\n---\n\nIn the file dialog that opens, locate the Designkit we cloned in step 2. Remember the last command `echo $PWD`? At the path your terminal printed for this command you can find the Designkit.\n\nMake sure to select the `package.json` file in the `designkit` folder. \n\nAnalysing the DesignKit should take Alva just a few seconds. \nYou can verify everything worked if the library pane looks roughly like the screenshot below. \n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/libraries.svg)\n\nNotice the second library with the green \"Connected\" indicator? That is the Designkit we just added.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Put connected Patterns to use\n\nApart from listing the Designkit in the libraries pane, connecting it had a second more subtle effect. \nIf you scroll down in your patterns list, you can find new patterns:\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/pattern-list.png)\n\nLet's put what we learned in the [Essentials](./doc/docs/guides/essentials?guides-enabled=true) guide to use and \nput a Designkit button element in our prototype. Double click on the button pattern. Alva should render an empty button element on the preview. Change the `Order` property to `Primary` to give it a nice solild background.\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/empty-button.png)\n\nNext, let's add some text to the button. Locate the `Text` pattern in the pattern list and drag it onto the\nbutton. Then change its text property to something, e.g. \"Hello there.\". \n\nYour Alva screen should look like this now:\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/text-button.png)\n\n:tada: Congratulations! You just used your first third-party code pattern in Alva. \n\n---\n\n## Next\n\n* **Next**: [Interaction](./doc/docs/guides/interaction?guides-enabled=true)\n","contentType":"doc","path":"docs/guides/library.md","manifest":{"name":"guide-3---connect-a-pattern-library","displayName":"Guide 3 - Connect a Library","description":"","flag":"alpha","options":{},"tags":["guide"],"version":"1.0.0"},"rawManifest":{"displayName":"Guide 3 - Connect a Library","tags":["guide"]}},{"id":"docs/guides/start","contents":"---\ndisplayName: Overview\ntags:\n  - guide\n  - entry\noptions:\n    order: -1\n---\n\n# Alva Guides\nWith these guides you will learn how Alva works and how you can use it to supercharge your products.

Add Input\nTo show interactivity we need an interactive component. Let's **add an input**.\n\n> Technical Note: For Interactive Elements you need an `React.ChangeEventHandler` or `React.EventHandler` property.\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/guides/guide-04-01.gif)\n\n## 2. Define a variable\nBelow the input properties you'll find an **Interaction Property**. **Set it to** `Set Variable`.\nNext **give it a name** by typing in your desired name.\nLastly you need to define the **Payload**. Set it to `value`.\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/guides/guide-04-02.gif)\n\n## 3. Link component to a value\nTo make use of your defined variable, you need to consume it in a component.\nIn the *Input* component click on the *link* icon at the *value property* and select your previously defined variable.\n\n![](https://media.meetalva.io/guides/guide-04-03.gif)\n\n## 4.

By subscribing to our newsletter, you agree to the receipt and the procedures described.\n\nThe legal basis for sending our newsletter is your consent via double opt-in according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.\n\n### Newsletter Content\nWe send newsletters and e-mails containing promotional information (hereinafter referred to as “Newsletter”) only with the consent of the recipient. Provided that in the context of a registration to the newsletter whose contents are specifically described, they are decisive for the consent of the users. In our newsletters we inform you periodically about current developments of Alva and further events by email.\n\n### Use of “MailChimp” shipping service provider\nWe use MailChimp to send our newsletter to our subscribers. MailChimp is a service provided by The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 512 Means Street, Suite 404, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA.\n\nThe email addresses of our newsletter recipients, as well as any other information described in this notice, are stored on the servers of MailChimp in the USA. MailChimp uses this information for sending and to evaluate the newsletters on our behalf. Furthermore, MailChimp can use its own information to check these Use data to optimize or improve your own services, e.g. to technically optimize shipping and the presentation of the newsletter or for economic purposes, in order to determine from which countries the recipients come.\n\nThe data stored when you registered for the newsletter (E-mail address, name, IP address, and time and date of registration) will be sent to a server operated by The Rocket Science Group in the United States and stored there in accordance with the EU-US Privacy Shield. MailChimp uses this information for sending and to evaluate the newsletters on our behalf. Furthermore, MailChimp can use its own information to check these Use data to optimize or improve your own services, e.g. to technically optimize shipping and the presentation of the newsletter or for economic purposes, in order to determine from which countries the recipients come. However, MailChimp does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write them down itself or to send them back to us.\n\nWe trust in the reliability and IT and data security of MailChimp. MailChimp is protected under the US-EU Data Protection Agreement “Privacy Shield” and is thus committed to comply with EU data protection regulations. Furthermore, we have created with MailChimp a “Data Processing Agreement”. This is a contract, in which MailChimp is responsible for to protect the data of our users in accordance with their data protection regulations on our behalf and in particular not to pass them on to third parties.

This means that you will receive an e-mail after registration, in which you will be asked to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can log on with foreign e-mail addresses. The registrations for the newsletter are recorded in order to be able to prove the registration process according to legal requirements. Therefore we store the login and the confirmation time, as well as the IP address. Also, the changes to your data stored with the shipping service provider (MailChimp) are logged.\n\n### Logon data\nTo subscribe to the newsletter, it is sufficient to provide your e-mail address. Optionally, we ask you to give a name in the newsletter for personal address.\n\n### Newsletter Consent\nYou will be asked to consent to the use of your personal data to receive our newsletter as follows:\n\n“By entering your e-mail address and clicking the button below, you confirm that you are 16 years or older. You agree that Alva (represented by SinnerSchrader Deutschland GmbH, Völckersstraße 38, 22765 Hamburg) will use the data and information provided by you in connection with the use of the newsletter to regularly send you information about Alva by e-mail. By clicking below, you agree that Alva may process your information in accordance with these terms. You can change your mind at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the footer of any e-mail you receive from us, or by contacting us at hey@meetalva.io. Alva will treat your information with respect. For further information, please see our privacy policy on our website.”\n\n### Statistical survey and analysis\nThe newsletters contain a so-called “web-beacon”. A pixel-sized file retrieved from the server of the shipping service provider when the newsletter is opened. Within the framework of this call, technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of the call-up are collected. This information is used to technically improve the services based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behavior by means of their polling points (which can be determined using the IP address) or the access times. Statistical surveys also include determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened, and which links are clicked. This information can be assigned to individual newsletter recipients for technical reasons. It is, however, neither our endeavor, nor that of the shipping service provider, to observe individual users. The evaluations are much more useful for us to recognize the reading habits of our users and adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.\n\n### Cancellation / Revocation\nWe may process your personal data until you revoke your consent. You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consent. So that goes out at the same time your consents to its dispatch via MailChimp and the statistical analyses. A separate revocation of sending via MailChimp or the statistical evaluation is unfortunately not possible.\n\nA link to cancel the newsletter can be found at the end of each newsletter.\n\nFor instructions to take this step, please refer to the confirmation e-mail and each newsletter.\n\n## Link to third parties\n### Embedding of external platforms\nYou will find links to other websites on this website, directly or indirectly by means of links. The legal basis for such processing is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. We may process your personal data until our legitimate interest ceases to exist.\n\nWe hereby expressly distance ourselves from all contents of these sites to which links are established and do not adopt these contents as our own.

A production-level example of an Alva-enabled pattern library it the [Alva Designkit](https://github.com/meetalva/designkit/)\nwhich is openly available on GitHub.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Contains a `package.json`\n- **Implementation Entry**: Specifies an `alva:main` / `main` field in `package.json` or contains an `index.js` file\n- **Interface Entry**: Specifies `typings` in `package.json` or contains an `.d.ts` file with the same basename as the provided implementation entry. E.g. if the implementation entry is `lib/my-lib.js`, the typings are assumed to be at `lib/my-lib.d.ts`\n- **Implementation Exports**: All components that should be usable in Alva are (re)exported from the implementation entry.\nThey are implemented in React.\n- **Browser Compatibility**: The exported code uses only APIs that are available in browsers.\n\n\n## Analyzer Algorithm\n\nAlvas static analyzer follows a set of steps and rules when reading your pattern library.\n\n## 1. Read meta data\n- 1. Read and parse `package.json` as JSON\n\n## 2. Find Implementation Entry\n- 2. a) Has `.alva:main` field: Use as JavaScript \n- 2. b) Has no `.alva:main`, but `.main` field: Use as JavaScript \n- 2. c) Has neither `.alva:main`,  nor `.main` field: Use `index.js` as JavaScript\n\n##  3. Find Interface Entry\n- 3. a) Has `.alva:typings` field: Use as TypeScript\n- 3. b) Has `.typings` field: Use as TypeScript\n- 3. c) Has `.alva:main`. Use `.d.ts` file with same basename (`some/path/lib.js` => `some/path/lib.d.ts`)\n- 3. d) Has `.main`. Use `.d.ts` file with same basename\n- 3. e) None of the above: Use `index.d.ts`\n","contentType":"doc","path":"docs/references/library-requirements.md","manifest":{"name":"pattern-library","displayName":"Pattern Library","description":"","flag":"alpha","options":{},"tags":["reference"],"version":"1.0.0"},"rawManifest":{"tags":["reference"]}},{"id":"docs/references/properties","contents":"---\ntags:\n  - reference\n---\n\n# Properties\n\nWith properties you bring your components to life.\nAlva analyzes your React property interfaces to present \nyou with an appropriate editing UI.\n\n## Supported Component Interfaces\n\nAlva searches your component libray for exports that match\none of the following types:\n\n* `React.SFC<T>`\n* `React.ComponentClass<T>`\n* `React.PureComponent<T>`\n* `React.StatelessComponent<T>`\n* `React.ComponentType<T>`\n\nIn the list above `T` is assumed to fulfill the constraints \n\n```ts\n{ [key: string]: any };\n```\n\nWhich is a fancy way of saying we assume you use the plain object interface that is conventional in the React community.\n\n> :warning:\n> **Heads up**!\n> Alva does not support type aliasing of React component types yet.\n> This means **this won't work**:\n> \n> ```ts\n> import * as React from 'react';\n> \n> type C = React.SFC;\n> \n> export const Component: C = () => <h1>Component</h1>;\n> ```\n\n\n## Supported Property Types\n\nAlva creates dedicated editing UI for the following \ntypes.
