        <h2>Design and engineering, tied together</h2>
        <p>You can start with a minimal set of components to sketch concepts like wireframes and do fast iterations with your development team to create and enrich components, from atoms to modules and entire pages with production-ready code.</p>

        <h2>Cross&shy;functional single source of truth</h2>
        <p>Maintaining a separate design library next to the developer’s component library is quite weird. That’s why Alva lets you design with exactly the same code components your engineers use for the final application.</p>

            <h2>Based on React components</h2>
            <p>All components are based on React, that means you are designing with real code instead of just static shadow copies in a former design tool. But if youre new component is not already developed, you can just drop in a PNG out of Sketch  (Constraint driven design)</p>

                    <p>The web is interactive, so we should design interactively, too. Alva allows designing complex interactive experiences.</p>

        <h2>Different user, different perspective</h2>
        <p>Alva either connects to a already existing component library or assists you creating a new one. So as a designer you use a shared library with all your developers and always have the latest version.</p>
