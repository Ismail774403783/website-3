        <p>A radically new design tool that enables cross-functional teams to design digital products.</p>

        <h2>Design and engineering, tied together</h2>
        <p>You can start with a minimal set of components to sketch concepts like wireframes and do fast iterations with your development team to create and enrich components, from atoms to modules and entire pages with production-ready code.</p>

        <h2>Crossfunctional single source of truth</h2>
        <p>Maintaining a separate design library next to the developerâ€™s component library is quite weird. Thatâ€™s why Karla lets you design with exactly the same code components your engineers use for the final application.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Based on React components</h2>
        <p>All components are based on React, that means you are designing with real code instead of just static shadow copies in a former design tool. But if youre new component is not already developed, you can just drop in a PNG out of Sketch  (Constraint driven design)</p>

        <h3>Custom code integration</h3>
        <p>If youâ€™d like to implement custom logic or anything else code-based, you can insert custom code anywhere. So Designers donâ€™t have to code. But they are able to.</p>

        <h3>Prototype design with live data</h3>
        <p>You want to translate your designs into a dozen of languages? Or want to connect to real data? Donâ€™t worry, Karla supports that.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Different user, different perspective</h2>
        <p>Karla either connects to a already existing component library or assists you creating a new one. So as a designer you use a shared library with all your developers and always have the latest version.</p>
